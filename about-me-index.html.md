Hello! I have been an ardent developer ever since i first got my PC when i was 12 Years old. I Started out as a Web developer but later picked up Mobile as my most favourite platform to develop applications.

I am currently a Full-time developer with a FANG company and also spend my other half of the day creating and teaching Programming. There are a lot of applications live on the Google Play-Store (Check them below) and additionally also write and make videos on Android and Other Programming Languages! If you wish to connect, hit me up on LinkedIn.
